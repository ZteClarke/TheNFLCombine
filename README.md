# TheNFLCombine

In this project, I explore and analyze National Football League Combine data from 1999 through 2014. 

The original dataset can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1hvpp5Sdvbm2CdEUVkUKKKDhT3wtoEy/edit#gid=1748062974

The original dataset contained 4626 rows and 26 columns.

I focused my project on the exploration of combine result for each specific position. 

The following questions lead my analysis: 
-	What position is most picked in the draft? 
-	Which colleges have the most drafted players? 
- What physical attributes does a typical draftee have? 
- How Important is the Combine to finding players who are successful in the NFL?

This project was completed using SQL, Excel, Tableau, and PowerPoint.
